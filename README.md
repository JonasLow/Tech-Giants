<h6>Project by Jonas Low & Qin Haichen</h6>

## Inspiration
JP Morgan's 2024 top picks: Google and Amazon. This ignited our curiosity about their potential in the coming year. We wanted to go beyond simply analyzing their financial data and delve into their strengths, weaknesses, and future trajectories.

## What it does
"The Tech Titans" is an interactive platform that provides:

- **In-depth analysis of Google and Amazon's financials**: This includes revenue breakdowns, profit margins, market share comparisons, and key performance indicators.
- **Visually compelling dashboards**: Interactive charts and graphs bring the data to life, allowing users to explore trends, correlations, and potential risks and opportunities.
- **Unbiased insights**: The platform avoids financial jargon and presents information in a clear, accessible way, empowering users to make informed investment decisions.

## How we built it
The project was built using a combination of tools:

- **Data acquisition**: APIs were used to gather financial data from sources like Yahoo Finance and Google Finance. Additional data points were sourced from news articles, analyst reports, and industry publications.
- **Data wrangling and analysis**: Python was used to clean, manipulate, and analyze the data, identifying key trends and relationships.
- **Visualization**: Tableau was utilized to create interactive dashboards and charts, transforming complex data into visually appealing and informative formats.

## Challenges we ran into
1. **Data inconsistency**: Different data sources provided slightly different figures, requiring careful validation and cross-referencing.
2. **Overcoming technical hurdles**: Learning new programming languages and navigating complex APIs presented ongoing challenges.
3. **Staying unbiased**: As a project inspired by JP Morgan's picks, maintaining objectivity and presenting a neutral perspective required careful consideration.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
1. **Creating an accessible and engaging platform**: The project translates complex financial data into an understandable and visually appealing format for a wider audience.
2. **Unveiling hidden insights**: The analysis uncovered valuable insights into Google and Amazon's potential, including their dependence on economic cycles, cloud dominance challenges, and hidden gems within their financials.
3. **Empowering informed investment decisions**: The platform equips users with the knowledge and tools to make informed investment choices based on data and insights, not just hype.

## What we learned
1. **The importance of critical thinking**: Questioning assumptions, validating data, and considering multiple perspectives are crucial in navigating the complexities of the financial landscape.
2. **The value of collaboration**: This project benefited greatly from the diverse skills and perspectives of the team, highlighting the power of teamwork in tackling complex challenges.

## What's next for The Tech Titans: Unraveling Google & Amazon's 2024 Potential
- **Expanding the scope**: Analyzing additional tech giants or exploring specific industry trends could provide further valuable insights.
- **Integrating machine learning**: Utilizing AI to analyze vast amounts of data and identify emerging trends could enhance the platform's predictive capabilities.
- **Building a community**: Creating a platform for users to share insights, discuss investment strategies, and learn from each other could foster a valuable learning environment.
- **Continuing the story**: As Google and Amazon evolve, the platform can adapt and update its analysis, providing users with ongoing insights into their potential and impact on the world.

By continuously learning, adapting, and expanding, "The Tech Titans" aims to remain a valuable resource for understanding the stories these tech giants weave, not just with their numbers, but with the impact they have on our lives and the future we build.
